Description   The design is for a shipment dashboard where the various shipments are shown which are going through various vendors like FedEx, Bluedart etc.. The dashboard shows these shipments, give their current status by a timeline view, and there are some counters which shows the number of shipments which are in a particular state e.g. DEL (Delivered), INT (In Transit), OOD (Out for Delivery) etc….   Replicate the Design [1][2]. Use API endpoint [3] to fetch Shipments and show them in the right hand tabular view [1]. HTTP Method - POST  The API requires some data to be passed in various places in the API which are :- Bearer Token - tTU3gFVUdP Body - { email: [your_email_address] e.g. {email: “mayankmittal@intugine.com”}  }  Response contains “data” key which is an array which will be used for the data. Shown in Data sample below. Calculate the counter values from the data using ‘current_status_code’ in the shipment data. Table View (RIght) On selecting different status counter ( 3rd point ) show shipments of the selected status. Use filtered data based on selected counter e.g. DEL, INT, OOD. DEL (Delivered) counter will be selected by default. Timeline View [1] (Left) Use `scan` array in the shipment data for this. The no. of elements in the timeline will be same as of `scan` array length Each element within the timeline view will contain the data which is available in individual elements of the `scan` array and mentioned in the Data sample below.
